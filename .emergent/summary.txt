<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to fix real-time exchange rate updates and improve the UI of their React Native RIS application. However, persistent and severe issues with responsive layouts on desktop and aggressive Cloudflare caching led to extreme user frustration.

After multiple failed attempts to fix the layout and caching problems, the user made a critical decision to abandon the React Native for Web approach entirely. The new, overriding directive is to **rebuild the entire frontend as a standard, responsive web application using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**, while ensuring all existing functionality is migrated.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
The project is in a transitional state.
- **Backend:** A functional FastAPI backend exists and is stable. It includes all necessary APIs for authentication, rates, and the newly added admin remittance endpoints.
- **Old Frontend (DEPRECATED):** The original React Native/Expo application in the  directory is now considered deprecated and should not be worked on. It serves only as a reference for existing logic and UI.
- **New Frontend (IN PROGRESS):** A new project has been scaffolded in  using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The basic file structure, dependencies (), and configuration files (, ) have been created. Placeholder files for pages (Login, Dashboard), components, and contexts have been generated but contain no functional code yet.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent had just started the major task of rebuilding the entire frontend. The work involved creating a new React + Vite project structure in the  directory, installing dependencies, and creating placeholder files for the new application architecture.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent. Once a basic feature like the login flow is re-implemented in the new React app, the testing agent should be used to verify its functionality end-to-end.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
This section is superseded by the main migration task. All previous issues are expected to be resolved by the new implementation.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: **Rebuild the Frontend with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (P0)**
     - Where to resume: The basic project skeleton exists in . The immediate next step is to start implementing the core features, beginning with the **authentication flow**. This involves:
        1. Populating  with authentication logic (login, logout, user state).
        2. Building the UI and logic for the  page.
        3. Creating a router setup in  to handle public and private routes.
     - What will be achieved with this?: This will create a modern, maintainable, and truly responsive web application, resolving the layout and caching issues that plagued the previous version.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Both. The frontend implementation needs to be thoroughly tested, and backend endpoints need to be confirmed as correctly integrated.
     - Blocked on something: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **(P0) Port All Features to the New React App:** Systematically re-implement all existing functionality from the old React Native app into the new web app. The order should be:
        1.  **Authentication:** Login, Logout, and route protection.
        2.  **Main User Dashboard:** Displaying user balance and key information.
        3.  **Real-Time Exchange Rates:** Re-implement the API polling for rates and display them globally.
        4.  **Core Features:** Rebuild the Send, Recharge, Profile, and History pages.
        5.  **Admin Panel:** Re-create the full-featured Process Remittances screen () with its tabs, filters, and modals.
        6.  **Support:** Implement the support modal for unauthenticated users.
    - **(P1) Configure New Deployment Workflow:** Once the new web app is functional, establish a new build (yarn run v1.22.22

    Future Tasks:
    - **(P2) Stripe Integration:** Blocked until the user activates their Stripe account.
    - **(P3) Web Push Notifications:** The previous Expo push notification system is incompatible. A new strategy using web push APIs will be needed.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Admin Remittance Panel Created (in old app):** A comprehensive UI for processing remittances was successfully built in the old admin panel, with status tabs, filters, search, and pagination. This design should be used as a blueprint for the new React implementation.
- **Backend Endpoints for Admin:** New endpoints  and  were created in  to support the new admin panel.
- **Unauthenticated Support Button:** The functionality for a support modal on the login screen was implemented in the old app and should be ported.
- **Attempted Fixes (Now Obsolete):** Numerous attempts were made to fix real-time rates, responsive layouts, and Cloudflare caching issues in the old React Native app. While these efforts ultimately led to the decision to rebuild, they provided valuable insight into the platform's limitations.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - The fundamental layout and caching issues with the React Native for Web build were never fully resolved, leading to the current frontend rebuild task.
   - Push notification functionality remains pending and requires a new approach for the web platform.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - Issue recurrence in previous fork: Push notifications not working.
  - Recurrence count: 2
  - Status: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend Migration:** A complete technology stack migration for the frontend from React Native/Expo to a standard web stack: **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**. This is to gain better control over responsiveness, layout, and caching.
- **Responsive First Design:** The new application must be built from the ground up with a responsive design that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop browsers.

**key DB schema**
  - No changes were made to the database schema.
  - **withdrawals**: Stores remittance requests, used by the new admin panel.

**changes in tech stack**
  - **Major Frontend Overhaul:** The frontend stack has been changed from **React Native/Expo** to **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**.

**All files of reference**
- **New Project (Primary):** The entire  directory.
- **Old Project (For Logic/UI Reference):** , , , .
- **Backend:** .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The entire frontend is being rebuilt from scratch. The old  directory should be considered read-only for reference and will be deleted upon completion of the migration.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **User Frustration is High:** The user is extremely frustrated by the previous failures and has spent significant credits. It is critical to be efficient, avoid repeating mistakes, and deliver a functional, responsive web application to regain trust.
- **PRIORITY #1: REBUILD THE FRONTEND:** Do not, under any circumstances, work on the old  directory. All development must now occur in the new  project. The user's instruction to rebuild was clear and final.
- **Focus on a Responsive Web App:** The primary reason for the rebuild is to fix layout issues. Build a proper responsive web application that looks and works great on both mobile and desktop screens.
- **Port All Existing Functionality:** The user expects the new application to have all the features of the old one, including the newly designed admin remittance panel. Use the old application's code as a reference for logic.
- **New Build Process:** The build process will now be yarn run v1.22.22

- **User gave a clear, one-word command: hazlo (do it).** (Status: In Progress)
- User confirmed the agent should proceed, keeping all existing functionality and ensuring the new app is responsive for mobile and desktop. (Status: In Progress)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The frontend is in a state of total migration. The old application is deprecated, and the new one is an empty shell. The application is not currently usable by end-users.
- **Mocked:** None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Frontend hosting.
- **Railway**: Backend and Database hosting.
- **GitHub**: Source code management.
- **Twilio**: SMS and WhatsApp messaging.
- **Expo Push Notifications**: Will need to be replaced with a web-based push notification solution.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: YES (on the old app)
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: None.
  - Known regressions: The entire frontend is a regression in the sense that it is currently non-functional pending the rebuild.
